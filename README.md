# Bus-route-optimization-using-Dijkstra-alogorithm
Bus Route Optimization System (Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm)

This is a web-based bus route optimization application developed as a project. The system is designed to help passengers and drivers identify the shortest and most efficient bus routes between two locations. It uses Dijkstra’s algorithm for route optimization and provides interactive dashboards for both passengers and drivers.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript

Mapping & Routing: Leaflet.js, Leaflet Routing Machine, OpenStreetMap APIs

Middleware/Backend: JavaScript (client-side logic, can be extended to Node.js/Flask for backend services)

Database: Local Storage (for saving and retrieving routes)

Features
Passenger Module

Plan a journey by selecting source and destination.

Find optimized bus routes using Dijkstra’s Algorithm.

Interactive map visualization of the route.

Receive traffic alerts and suggested alternative routes.

Save and reuse frequently traveled routes.

View nearby transport options (Metro, Bus, Auto, Train, etc.).

Provide ratings and feedback for previous journeys.

Driver Module

Dashboard showing:

Current Speed

Distance Covered

Number of Passengers

Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA)

Speed Monitor with real-time updates.

Emergency alerts (traffic, accidents, diversions).

Set and display optimized routes on the map.

View upcoming stops with ETA and waiting passengers.

Admin / Future Scope

Manage passenger and driver data.

Monitor overall transport network efficiency.

Generate reports on traffic patterns and frequently used routes.

Integrate with real-time GPS & IoT devices for live tracking.

Project Setup

Step 1: Extract the Project

unzip Bus-route-optimization.zip
cd Bus-route-optimization


Step 2: Run Locally

Open Bus route optimization using Dijkstra algorithm.html in a browser.

Or use Live Server in VS Code for smooth navigation.

Step 3 (Optional – Backend Integration):

Extend with Flask/Django/Node.js for real-time database support.

Connect to MySQL/PostgreSQL for saving user data and route analytics.

Highlights

Implementation of Dijkstra’s Algorithm for optimal pathfinding.

Passenger & Driver separate dashboards with different features.

Leaflet.js maps with real-time routing.

Local Storage support for saving routes.

Traffic alerts and emergency reporting system.

Extendable to IoT-enabled smart transport systems.

Topics Covered

Graph theory and Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm.

Web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

Interactive mapping using Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.

Local Storage-based route management.

Designing Passenger–Driver dashboards.

Future scope for real-time data integration and admin monitoring.

This project demonstrates how graph algorithms and web technologies can be applied to solve real-world transport optimization problems. It can be extended into a complete Smart Transport Management System with real-time tracking and AI-based traffic predictions.
